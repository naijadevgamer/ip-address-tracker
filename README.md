<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## üåç Overview

![screenshot](./src/app.png)

Welcome to my IP Address Tracker App! This app allows you to discover key information about an IP address or domain, including its location on an interactive map. Whether you want to track an IP address for security purposes or just for curiosity, this app makes it easy and fun! üåçüìç

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This application was built using the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - Interactive maps
- [IPWHOIS Geolocation API](https://ipwhois.io/) - IP tracking and location data
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

### What I Learned

Building the IP Address Tracker app was an exciting experience. I learned a lot about integrating third-party APIs using TypeScript. The project also gave me the opportunity to work with Leaflet, which made creating dynamic maps straightforward and enjoyable. This project has definitely enhanced my skills in creating interactive web applications! üöÄ

One of the most challenging aspects was parsing the data from the IP Geolocation API and ensuring the map displayed accurately based on the user's search input. It was a rewarding experience to see it all come together!

Throughout this project, I honed my skills in writing clean, maintainable code by adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, and I also optimize the code for better performance.

### My Wisdom üåü

Here's a piece of wisdom from my journey: _"Stay curious and always be willing to dive into the unknown."_ Trying new APIs and tools might seem daunting at first, but the learning process is incredibly rewarding.
